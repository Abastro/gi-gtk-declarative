# Installation

The gi-gtk-declarative package builds on
[gi-gtk](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk), and thus depend
on the same libraries. For instructions on how to install GTK+
dependencies using your package manager of choice, have a look at [the
project
README](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi#installation).

!!! warning

    Using gi-gtk and this package with GHC 8.2.x
    [is not recommended](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi#%EF%B8%8F-ghc-82x-%EF%B8%8F)!

Once you have those installed, it should be a regular Haskell package
install with Cabal, Stack, Nix, or whatever floats your boat.
