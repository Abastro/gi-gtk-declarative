This is an experimental package! Expect breaking changes during the
0.x versions, and be prepared to find bugs, surprising behavior, and
missing functionality. If you do find something, or think that
documentation could be better, please [submit an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/owickstrom/gi-gtk-declarative).

If you want to help develop gi-gtk-declarative:

1. Look around the reported issues on GitHub if there's anything you
can pick up.
2. Begin by discussing the issue in the comments, such that we have
reached a common understanding of the problem and a design.
3. Announce that you're going to start working on it.
